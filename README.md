## This repo is used to keep track of issues for all GreenBlack's watchfaces


If you find an issue, please post it in the issue tracker, or email me at greenblack at watchface.io so I can put it in here.



### How to post an issue
1. In the issue tracker, click "New Issue": 
2. Pick the issue type:
   - Bug: Something is broken 
   - Feature: A new feature you would like
   - Enhancement: Something to make an existing feature better
   - High Priority: Something that needs an immediate fix (Usually crashes)
   - Task: Something GreenBlack needs to do, not really for public use
3. Write down a descriptive title, include the watchface name
4. In the body, describe the issue. You can also drag pictures in there to make it more clear. Not all the suggested data is needed. One sentence might be enough to describe the issue (Example: When I select background "blue", the face crashes on my Fenix 8 47mm amoled.)
5. IMPORTANT: Use LABEL to mark the face this issue happens on. If it happens on multiple or all faces, pick "All faces", or select all the faces you have been it on
6. Press Create issue to save it


### When will my issue be looked at?
I will look at your issue the moment it comes in, and if nessesary will fix the issue right away.


### How do you organize things?
The way I work is I open a project I'm working on, for example Fenix 8 V2, then pull in all the issues that are in the tracker for this face, and will go over them one by one until they are all fixed (or dismissed). When all issues are out the way, an update will be pushed to the Garmin IQ store. Features/enhancements are lower on the priority list, so it can be features are skipped when a bug needs to be fixed. Some projects have milestones to keep track of what will be added in the next releases.
